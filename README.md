# road_lane_detection_cnn



In this school project, we're going to be working on an automatic Lane Detection which can be used in self-driving cars or using it as an alert system, for example in case the driver is falling asleep or still learning how to drive properly. tThis solution can be done using classic image processing with OpenCv2, but the traditional lane detection method is improved, and the current popular convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to build a dual model based on instance segmentation. In the image acquisition and processing processes, the distributed computing architecture provided by edge-cloud computing is used to improve data processing efficiency. The lane fitting process generates a variable matrix to achieve effective detection in the scenario of slope change, which improves the real-time performance of lane detection.
